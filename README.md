## 1. RoadBuddy 📝 

<h3>💡Concepts💡</h3>
- Road buddy is an application that helps prevent drowsy driving accidents. Made using Android Studio, Kotlin and Java, it supports wear os. When set to driving mode when the driver starts driving, the driver is notified of vibration when the heart rate is measured and lowered below a specific heart rate.

<h3>🎯Our solution🎯</h3>
- We searched for an API in Wear OS that could monitor heartbeats and integrated it with Roadbuddy. The API measures an average heart rate and sends a notification to the driver when it falls below a certain threshold. In the system, the heart rate threshold is typically set at 62 or lower, which is considered to indicate drowsiness. When the heart rate drops below this level, Wear OS sends a vibration to the driver to help them stay alert.

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
- From GM's challenge question, our aims is to achieve one of their vision of "Zero Crashes". Although it may be virtually impossible to completely eliminate all accidents, we concentrate on preventing those that could happen due to driver fatigue, such as drowsy driving.

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
- The driver may be able to be awakened by vibrations, but it might not be sufficient. The drop in heart rate can be caused by factors other than drowsy driving. To address this, we suggest sending vibrations and voice alerts. The Wear OS system should also record the average heart rate and other relevant health information of users to provide accurate health analysis and determine the cause of heart rate drops.

<h4>What's next for RoadBuddy</h4>
- The API must be located and utilized to transmit vibrations and voice alarms, and research into ways to adjust or increase the vibration intensity should be conducted. In addition to addressing drowsy driving, the company is exploring the possibility of using Google Maps API to send vibrations and alarms to drivers when they exceed a certain speed in areas with high accident rates or child protection zones.
